# SWGChat #

An open implementation of the chat gateway that SOE based games used to provide various social communication features such as mail, custom chat rooms, friend management, etc.

## Implementation ##

Uses the SOE libraries to implement chat features in a standalone utility. Ideally, the completed implementation would allow for multiple galaxies to connect and allow players to communicate across them.
